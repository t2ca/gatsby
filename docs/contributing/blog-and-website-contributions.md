title: Blog & Website Contributions
---

We wholeheartedly welcome contributions to the Gatsby blog and website! Instructions on this page:

- [Contributing to the blog](#contributing-to-the-blog)
  - [Blog post format](#blog-post-format)
- [Making changes to the website](#making-changes-to-the-website)

## Contributing to the blog

Note: Before adding a blog post ensure you have approval from a member of the Gatsby team. You can do this by [opening an issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new/choose) or contacting [@gatsbyjs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs).

To add a new blog post to the gatsbyjs.org blog:

- Clone [the Gatsby repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) and navigate to `/www`
- Run `yarn` to install all of the website's dependencies. ([Why Yarn?](/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment#using-yarn))
- Run `npm run develop` to preview the blog at `http://localhost:8000/blog`.
- The content for the blog lives in the `/docs/blog` folder. Make additions or modifications here.
- Add your avatar image to `/docs/blog/avatars`
- Add your name to `/docs/blog/author.yaml`
- Add a new folder following the pattern `/docs/blog/yyyy-mm-dd-title`. Within this newly created folder add an `index.md` file.
- Add `title`, `date`, `author`, and `tags` ([view existing tags](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/) or add a new one) to the frontmatter of your `index.md`. If you are cross posting your post you can add `canonicalLink` for SEO benefits. You can check the other blog posts in `/docs/blog` for examples.
- If your blog post contains images add them to your blog post folder and reference them in your post's `index.md`.
- Ensure any links to gatsbyjs.org are relative links - `/contributing/how-to-contribute/` instead of `https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute`
- Follow the [Style Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/#word-choice) to make sure you're using the appropriate wording.
- Double check your grammar and capitalise correctly
- Commit and push to your fork
- Create a pull request from your branch
  - We recommend using a prefix of `docs`, e.g. `docs/your-change` or `docs-your-change` ([PR example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/commit/9c21394add7906974dcfd22ad5dc1351a99d7ceb#diff-bf544fce773d8a5381f64c37d48d9f12))

### Blog post format

The following format can help you in creating your new blog content. At the top is "frontmatter", a fancy name for metadata in Markdown; the frontmatter for your post should include a title, date, singular author name (for now, we would welcome issues/PRs for this), and one or more tags. Your content will follow, after the second set of dashes (`---`).

```md
---
title: "Your Great Blog Post"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: John Doe
tags:
  - awesome
  - post
---

Your next great blog post awaits!

Include images by creating a folder for your post and including
Markdown and image files for easy linking.

```

## Making changes to the website

If you want to make changes, improvements, or add new functionality to the website: like with the blog, you don't have to set up the full Gatsby repo to contribute. You can spin up your own instance of the Gatsby website with these steps:

- Clone [the Gatsby repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) and navigate to `/www`
- Run `yarn` to install all of the website's dependencies.
- Run `npm run develop` to preview the site at `http://localhost:8000/`.

> Note: If you are experiencing issues on a Linux machine, run `sudo apt install libvips-dev`, to install a native dependency. You can also reference [Gatsby guide on Linux](/docs/gatsby-on-linux/) for other Linux-specific requirements.

Now you can make and preview your changes before raising a pull request!
